If this is your first look at `aqueduct`, the tutorials in the sidebar are for you. They are a manual, step-by-step guide to implementing your first `aqueduct` web server. They should take a total of 1-2 hours to go through and they will familiarize you with the basics of the framework.

Once familiar with `aqueduct`, it's best to create new projects using [wildfire](https://github.com/stablekernel/wildfire). It takes care of structuring a new project, boilerplate and important scripts for generating documentating, database schemas, running servers, automated testing and configuring instances.

See the API reference [on aqueduct's pub page](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/aqueduct).
