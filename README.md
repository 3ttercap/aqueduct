[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stablekernel/aqueduct.svg?token=pRK3Urzpf8MtkgDRq7WH&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stablekernel/aqueduct)

`aqueduct` is a server-side framework written in Dart, focusing on productivity and testability.

## New to aqueduct?

You can get started by reading the [tutorials](http://stablekernel.github.io/aqueduct/). The tutorials take you through the baby-steps of understanding how aqueduct is used to build web servers.

Installing Dart and `aqueduct` is covered in the [first chapter](http://stablekernel.github.io/aqueduct/tut/getting-started.html) and it's very quick.

If you don't yet know Dart, don't worry - it's easy to learn, especially if you come from Java, Objective-C, Swift and other C-like languages. We suggest the [language tour](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html) to get caught up to speed. You'll feel comfortable going through the `aqueduct` tutorials and cross-referencing the language tour at the same time.

## Documentation

You can find the API reference on the [Dart Package Manager, Pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/aqueduct).
